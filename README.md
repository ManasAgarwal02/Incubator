A web-app which can provide the valuable analysis of a webpage or a full website in well defined report format. User can choose on which device (PC/mobile) he wants to get the analysis report irrespective on which device user is working.

The analysis report will contain following information based on the device (PC/mobile) a user wants to analyze their websites :- 
* Average page load time of a website. 
* Average time a user is spending on a webpage. 
* First Input Delay - time from when a user first interacts with a web page after entering it to the time when the browser can start processing that interaction – when the browser’s main thread is idle. 
* Cumulative layout shift of the website. 
* The overall ranking of website in comparison with other similar website. 
* Page load time of a webpage. 
* Total Blocking time of a webpage.

Also, a website can provide the information of all the network request a webpage is making during the loading time and also provides the starting time and end time of that request a page is making from the time a page starts loading for the first time.

This can help developers to optimize their website for better user experiene and fast loadng time of their websites.

Future Plans:- Incorporating machine learning and data science for better analysis of data and providing the best possible 
               solution to a developer for better optimization of websites. Building correlation matrices between various analysis parameters 
                to find out which parameter can optimize the webpage in best possible way without compromising the functionality and visual asthetics of a website.
